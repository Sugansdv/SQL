-- Accounts
INSERT INTO accounts (account_id, customer_id, account_type) VALUES
(101, 1, 'Savings'),
(102, 2, 'Current'),
(103, 3, 'Savings'),
(104, 4, 'Savings'),

-- 4. Highest and lowest transaction amounts
SELECT

FROM transactions;

-- 5. Accounts with total withdrawals > â‚¹10,000 (HAVING)
SELECT

FROM transactions
GROUP BY account_id

-- 6. INNER JOIN customers and accounts
SELECT

    c.name AS customer_name,
    a.account_id,
    a.account_type
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN accounts a ON c.customer_id = a.customer_id;

-- 7. LEFT JOIN: Accounts with no transactions
SELECT 
    a.account_id,
    a.account_type,
    t.transaction_id
FROM accounts a
LEFT JOIN transactions t ON a.account_id = t.account_id
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL;

-- 8. SELF JOIN: Customers from same city
SELECT 
    c1.name AS customer_1,
    c2.name AS customer_2,
    c1.city
FROM customers c1
JOIN customers c2 
  ON c1.city = c2.city
